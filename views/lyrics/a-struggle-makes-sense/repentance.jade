  p.title 04. The Repentance

  p.part
    | It felt so real, that fearful dream
    | My frightened eyes were drowning in tears

  p.part
    | That horrid smell of an opiate hell
    | Reverted dreads and unending despair

  p.part
    | Woeful man, remorse, regret,
    | The only thing that is left is the dope

  p.part
    | No hope, no fucking hope,
    | Nowhere to go, I am dead to the world

  p.part
    | Cries
    | Nightmares have filled my eyes
    | Lies
    | Have poisoned my consciousness
    | Pain
    | So hateful so cruel so sly
    | I Will never be sober again

  p.part
    | I'm thrown into disaster,
    | There's no way to escape from this maze

  p.part
    | And yet again I'm trying to end this,
    | Though I know that I already failed

  p.part
    | Take me away, tie my hands to the faith
    | And kill that cursed memories

  p.part
    | I see demise right in front of my eyes,
    | It's gone too far I will never survive
